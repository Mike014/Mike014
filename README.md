# Hello, I'm Michele Grimaldi  

---

## **Python Developer & AI Researcher**  

I’m a **Python Developer** and **independent AI Researcher**, specializing in **AI Engineering, NLP, and Deep Learning**, with a strong foundation in **Sound Engineering and Technical Sound Design**.  

After initially pursuing studies in **Computer Science** and **Archaeology**, I decided to shift my focus, dedicating **three years to specializing in audio—covering [Technical Sound Design, Sound Engineering, and Composition](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cD3XXjNbSOPa6yLIrKldATM5bH1HIEbQ/view?usp=sharing)**. This led me to develop advanced **DSP algorithms**, **spatial audio**, and **AI-driven sound systems for video games** using **C++**, **JUCE**, and **Unreal Engine**. Later, returned to Computer Science, **[obtaining certifications](https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/Mike_014)** through CodeAcademy that **reinforced and expanded my existing knowledge**.

## **Work & Contributions**  
- Working on **freelance projects as Prompt Engineer** for **Outlier.ai** and **Mindtel-Innodata**, where I still freelance, my most important project is **Mistral Le Chat** (Italian version)
– Contributed to **[DocsGPT](https://github.com/arc53/DocsGPT/pull/1603)** and the **[NLTK library](https://github.com/nltk/nltk/pull/3364)**.  
- Developed **AI-driven solutions for model optimization with RLHF**.  
- Built **NLP chatbots**

   - [Low Pass Filter app](https://github.com/Mike014/Low-Pass-Filter-Application)
   - [Audio Transcription](https://github.com/Mike014/Audio-Transcription)
- Designed **[advanced spatial audio and DSP algorithms](https://github.com/Mike014/My-Cpp-Codes-For-UnrealEngine)** for video games. Some of these algorithms were used as the basis for Spatial Audio for the [unDAW project](https://github.com/Amir-BK/unDAW) [Screenshot](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/michele-grimaldi-599b36280_unrealengine-audioprogramming-gameaudio-activity-7208839650864443393-hO3M?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android&rcm=ACoAAESC4sUBor13UtZCF3fL54mDzpouFhn7Vvk)
- **Sound Designer for Cookie Cutter** and other **indie titles on Itch.io and Steam**. My **collaborative experiences include participation in Game Jams** and **voluntary projects**, notably a collaboration with fellow freelancers. We established a Discord group, **Remote Access Games**, which, despite being discontinued due to divergent member perspectives, serves as a significant [portfolio piece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8RWcV3Oncs&list=PLgKASgLUSpNaUfSrkMirwRU2skzNGbnRs&index=2).
   - [itch.io games](https://m1k3-s0und.itch.io/)

- I've written music for bands and for personal projects, released on platforms like [Bandcamp](https://michelegrimaldi014.bandcamp.com/).
- I conducted audio research for my former academy, [Mas Academy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uCXQlFRBgPy69P4dk_NHmG1Ye0-XswCk/view), which was published on YouTube and used in real-world projects and internships.

  - [Showcase of my artistic-technical-audio skills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsgEQlxeEZ8&list=PLgKASgLUSpNaUfSrkMirwRU2skzNGbnRs)
- **[Founder of BG Art House Studio](https://bg-arthouse.com/about-us/)**, an indie game company. (I stepped down from the company I founded shortly after.)
- Collaborated as a **Beta Tester for Ableton Live 12**, providing feedback on the integrated **spatial audio**, similar to that of Nuendo 12, through the beta testing platform.
- Worked as a **freelance journalist**, publishing **(two articles)** in the video game industry.
   - [First](https://www.icrewplay.com/bethesda-presente-alla-milan-games-week-2023/)

- [Freelance developer](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01a70267a59add4e6a), working on contract or occasional projects.
- I am part of a **[community of independent AI researchers](https://atlas-research.io)**, granting me access to a wealth of AI-related resources beyond my personal research.
## **AI Research & Neural Memory Systems**  
My research focuses on **[AI memory structures](https://github.com/Mike014/Memory_Augmented_AI)**, exploring how neural networks can develop **long-term memory systems** inspired by human cognition. I’ve published independent studies on **Zenodo**, proposing models that integrate **working memory, short-term, and long-term memory** into AI architectures.  

- [First Research on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/14976723)
- [Second Research on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/14988996)

I have also released two major AI research projects on **Ready Tensor Inc**:  
- **[NoVa](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/nova-a-personalized-ai-assistant-for-autonomous-agentic-interaction-GyV7qnYs2Bsc)** – A deep dive into **ChatGPT-like models**, analyzing their internal mechanisms and proposing structural improvements.  
- **[Omnia](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/omnia-hybrid-autoencoder-for-audio-spectrogram-reconstruction-and-enhancement-kZXyHHNcIvf4)** – An **auditory neural network**, extending AI cognition into **sound-based perception**, complementing my research on **memory and sensory-driven AI learning**.

These are some of **my articles exploring the world of Deep Learning**, but also expanding into broader themes such as **philosophy, quantum physics, love, and more.**
- [First](https://medium.com/@mikgrimaldi7/neural-network-training-process-cbaaf4185cb1)
- [Second](https://medium.com/@mikgrimaldi7/the-quantum-twin-soul-paradox-between-chance-and-fate-in-the-multiverse-cfb743fc3d6c)
- [Third](https://medium.com/@mikgrimaldi7/the-illusion-of-understanding-in-ai-5888f39ac19f)
- [Fourth](https://medium.com/@mikgrimaldi7/probabilistic-quantum-emotional-paradox-an-algorithmic-approach-3bbc2e1d9b03)

I am currently exploring **[generative AI and deep learning](https://github.com/Mike014/My_AI_Engineer_Portfolio_Projects)**, advancing my work in **AI cognition, neural architectures, and memory-inspired learning**, aiming to bridge **intelligence, creativity, and human-like memory systems** through **research, development, and open-source contributions**.
