# Hello, I'm Michele Grimaldi  

---

## **Python Developer & AI Researcher**  

Iâ€™m a **Python Developer** and **independent AI Researcher**, specializing in **AI Engineering, NLP, and Deep Learning**, with a strong foundation in **Sound Engineering and Technical Sound Design**.  

After studying **Computer Science** and **Archaeology**, I shifted my focus, dedicating **three years to specializing in audio**â€”covering **Technical Sound Design, Sound Engineering, and Composition**. This led me to develop **advanced DSP algorithms, spatial audio, and AI-driven sound systems** for video games using **C++, JUCE, and Unreal Engine**. Later, I returned to **Computer Science**, obtaining certifications that reinforced and expanded my existing knowledge.  

## **ðŸ›  Work & Contributions**  
- **Prompt Engineer at Mistral Le Chat** â€“ Contributed to **[DocsGPT](https://github.com/arc53/DocsGPT/issues/1445)** and the **[NLTK library](https://github.com/nltk/nltk/pull/3364)**.  
- Developed **AI-driven solutions for model optimization with RLHF**.  
- Built **NLP chatbots**
   - [SoundBot](https://github.com/Mike014/SoundBot)
   - [Chatbot_app](https://github.com/Mike014/Chatbot_App)
- **Interactive AI-powered audio systems**.
   - [Pink Noise Generator](https://github.com/Mike014/Pink-Noise-Website)
   - [Audio Classification](https://github.com/Mike014/Audio-Classification)
   - [Audio Sample Editor](https://github.com/Mike014/Audio-Sample-Editor)
   - [Low Pass Filter app](https://github.com/Mike014/Low-Pass-Filter-Application)
   - [Audio Transcription](https://github.com/Mike014/Audio-Transcription)
- Designed **[advanced spatial audio and DSP algorithms](https://github.com/Mike014/My-Cpp-Codes-For-UnrealEngine)** for video games.  
- **Sound Designer for Cookie Cutter** and other **indie titles on Itch.io and Steam**.
   - [itch.io games](https://m1k3-s0und.itch.io/)

   - [Collaborations 3](https://lucabrunetti.itch.io/ninja-pizza-and-the-lost-pineapple-sauce-version-xxl-turbo-italian-edition-2)
- I've written music for bands and for personal projects, released on platforms like [Bandcamp](https://michelegrimaldi014.bandcamp.com/).
- **[Founder of BG Art House Studio](https://bg-arthouse.com/about-us/)**, an indie game company. (I stepped down from the company I founded shortly after.)

## **ðŸ”¬ AI Research & Neural Memory Systems**  
My research focuses on **[AI memory structures](https://github.com/Mike014/Memory_Augmented_AI)**, exploring how neural networks can develop **long-term memory systems** inspired by human cognition. Iâ€™ve published independent studies on **Zenodo**, proposing models that integrate **working memory, short-term, and long-term memory** into AI architectures.  

- [First Research on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/14976723)
- [Second Research on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/14988996)

I have also released two major AI research projects on **Ready Tensor Inc**:  
- **ðŸ§  NoVa** â€“ A deep dive into **ChatGPT-like models**, analyzing their internal mechanisms and proposing structural improvements.  
- **ðŸŽµ Omnia** â€“ An **auditory neural network**, extending AI cognition into **sound-based perception**, complementing my research on **memory and sensory-driven AI learning**.  

I am currently exploring **generative AI and deep learning**, advancing my work in **AI cognition, neural architectures, and memory-inspired learning**, aiming to bridge **intelligence, creativity, and human-like memory systems** through **research, development, and open-source contributions**.
