## **Python Developer**  
I’m a **Python Developer** with expertise in **AI Engineering, NLP, and back-end development**, as well as a specialization in **Sound Engineering**.  

Skilled in **Django, PostgreSQL, Docker, and Machine Learning**, I worked as a **Prompt Engineer** for **Mistral Le Chat**, contributing to **DocsGPT** and the **NLTK library**. I developed **AI-driven solutions** for model optimization with **RLHF**, built **NLP chatbots**, and **designed advanced audio systems for video games** using **C++, JUCE, and Unreal Engine**.  

With a **strong background in spatial audio and DSP algorithms**, I have also **contributed as a sound designer** on titles like **Cookie Cutter** and other **indie video games released on Itch.io and Steam**. Additionally, I **founded BG Art House Studio, a small video game company**.  

I am currently exploring **generative AI and deep learning**.
