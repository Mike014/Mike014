# Hello, my name is Michele

I’m a **Junior Back-End Developer** with a background in **Audio Programming and Technical Sound Design**. My expertise includes DSP and developing software with Django. I’m also certified [in Music Technologies from Steinberg and in Programming](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michele-grimaldi-599b36280/details/certifications/).

I work with GitBash, MSYS2, and PowerShell. Currently, I focus on AI and NLP using libraries like NLTK and spaCy.

Explore my repositories for educational projects and experiments.

**Some of my repositories are educational** and contain experiments aimed at exploring new techniques and concepts. These projects serve as learning tools and may not be fully developed software solutions.
