# Hello, I'm Michele Grimaldi

## **Python Developer & AI Researcher**  

Iâ€™m a **Python Developer** and **independent AI Researcher**, specializing in **AI Engineering, NLP, and Deep Learning**, with a strong foundation in **Sound Engineering and Technical Sound Design**.  

After studying **Computer Science** and **Archaeology**, I shifted my focus, dedicating **three years to specializing in audio**â€”covering **Technical Sound Design, Sound Engineering, and Composition**. This led me to develop **advanced DSP algorithms, spatial audio, and AI-driven sound systems** for video games using **C++, JUCE, and Unreal Engine**. Later, I returned to **Computer Science**, obtaining certifications that reinforced and expanded my existing knowledge.  

## **ðŸ›  Work & Contributions**  
- **Prompt Engineer at Mistral Le Chat** â€“ Contributed to **DocsGPT** and the **NLTK library**.  
- Developed **AI-driven solutions for model optimization with RLHF**.  
- Built **NLP chatbots** and **interactive AI-powered audio systems**.  
- Designed **advanced spatial audio and DSP algorithms** for video games.  
- **Sound Designer for Cookie Cutter** and other **indie titles on Itch.io and Steam**.  
- **Founder of BG Art House Studio**, an indie game company.  

## **ðŸ”¬ AI Research & Neural Memory Systems**  
My research focuses on **AI memory structures**, exploring how neural networks can develop **long-term memory systems** inspired by human cognition. Iâ€™ve published independent studies on **Zenodo**, proposing models that integrate **working memory, short-term, and long-term memory** into AI architectures.  

I have also released two major AI research projects on **Ready Tensor Inc**:  
- **ðŸ§  NoVa** â€“ A deep dive into **ChatGPT-like models**, analyzing their internal mechanisms and proposing structural improvements.  
- **ðŸŽµ Omnia** â€“ An **auditory neural network**, extending AI cognition into **sound-based perception**, complementing my research on **memory and sensory-driven AI learning**.  

I am currently exploring **generative AI and deep learning**, advancing my work in **AI cognition, neural architectures, and memory-inspired learning**, aiming to bridge **intelligence, creativity, and human-like memory systems** through **research, development, and open-source contributions**.
