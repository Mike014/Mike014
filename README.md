# Hello, I'm Michele Grimaldi

## **Python Developer & AI Researcher**  

I’m a **Python Developer** and **independent AI Researcher**, specializing in **AI Engineering, NLP, and Deep Learning**, with a strong foundation in **Sound Engineering and Technical Sound Design**.  

After studying **Computer Science** and **Archaeology**, I shifted my focus, dedicating **three years to specializing in audio**—covering **Technical Sound Design, Sound Engineering, and Composition**. This led me to develop **advanced DSP algorithms, spatial audio, and AI-driven sound systems** for video games using **C++, JUCE, and Unreal Engine**. Later, I returned to **Computer Science**, obtaining certifications that reinforced and expanded my existing knowledge.  

## **Work & Contributions**  
- Working on **freelance projects as Prompt Engineer** for **Outlier.ai** and **Mindtel-Innodata**, where I still freelance, my most important project is **Mistral Le Chat** (Italian versione)
– Contributed to **[DocsGPT](https://github.com/arc53/DocsGPT/issues/1445)** and the **[NLTK library](https://github.com/nltk/nltk/pull/3364)**.  
- Developed **AI-driven solutions for model optimization with RLHF**.  
- Built **NLP chatbots**
   - [SoundBot](https://github.com/Mike014/SoundBot)
   - [Chatbot_app](https://github.com/Mike014/Chatbot_App)
- **Interactive AI-powered audio systems**.
   - [Pink Noise Generator](https://github.com/Mike014/Pink-Noise-Website)
   - [Audio Classification](https://github.com/Mike014/Audio-Classification)
   - [Audio Sample Editor](https://github.com/Mike014/Audio-Sample-Editor)
   - [Low Pass Filter app](https://github.com/Mike014/Low-Pass-Filter-Application)
   - [Audio Transcription](https://github.com/Mike014/Audio-Transcription)
- Designed **[advanced spatial audio and DSP algorithms](https://github.com/Mike014/My-Cpp-Codes-For-UnrealEngine)** for video games.  
- **Sound Designer for Cookie Cutter** and other **indie titles on Itch.io and Steam**. My **collaborative experiences include participation in Game Jams** and **voluntary projects**, notably a collaboration with fellow freelancers. We established a Discord group, **Remote Access Games**, which, despite being discontinued due to divergent member perspectives, serves as a significant [portfolio piece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8RWcV3Oncs&list=PLgKASgLUSpNaUfSrkMirwRU2skzNGbnRs&index=2).
   - [itch.io games](https://m1k3-s0und.itch.io/)
   - [Collaborations 1](https://sephuni.itch.io/cats-craving)
   - [Collaborations 2](https://lucabrunetti.itch.io/xenolith)
   - [Collaborations 3](https://lucabrunetti.itch.io/ninja-pizza-and-the-lost-pineapple-sauce-version-xxl-turbo-italian-edition-2)
- I've written music for bands and for personal projects, released on platforms like [Bandcamp](https://michelegrimaldi014.bandcamp.com/).
- I conducted audio research for my former academy, Mas Academy, which was published on YouTube and used in real-world projects and internships.
  - [Concepts related to audio physics, musical harmony.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9MVQWB868&list=PLgKASgLUSpNbvO4I4iia5Czahy57vtG5R)
  - [Showcase of my artistic-technical-audio skills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsgEQlxeEZ8&list=PLgKASgLUSpNaUfSrkMirwRU2skzNGbnRs)
- **[Founder of BG Art House Studio](https://bg-arthouse.com/about-us/)**, an indie game company. (I stepped down from the company I founded shortly after.)

## **AI Research & Neural Memory Systems**  
My research focuses on **[AI memory structures](https://github.com/Mike014/Memory_Augmented_AI)**, exploring how neural networks can develop **long-term memory systems** inspired by human cognition. I’ve published independent studies on **Zenodo**, proposing models that integrate **working memory, short-term, and long-term memory** into AI architectures.  

- [First Research on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/14976723)
- [Second Research on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/14988996)

I have also released two major AI research projects on **Ready Tensor Inc**:  
- **[NoVa](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/nova-a-personalized-ai-assistant-for-autonomous-agentic-interaction-GyV7qnYs2Bsc)** – A deep dive into **ChatGPT-like models**, analyzing their internal mechanisms and proposing structural improvements.  
- **[Omnia](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/omnia-hybrid-autoencoder-for-audio-spectrogram-reconstruction-and-enhancement-kZXyHHNcIvf4)** – An **auditory neural network**, extending AI cognition into **sound-based perception**, complementing my research on **memory and sensory-driven AI learning**.  

I am currently exploring **[generative AI and deep learning](https://github.com/Mike014/My_AI_Engineer_Portfolio_Projects)**, advancing my work in **AI cognition, neural architectures, and memory-inspired learning**, aiming to bridge **intelligence, creativity, and human-like memory systems** through **research, development, and open-source contributions**.
