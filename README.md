# Hello, my name is Michele

I am a **Software Developer** with a strong background in **Audio Programming** and **Technical Sound Design**. I specialize in **DSP (Digital Signal Processing)**, which involves manipulating digital audio signals to enhance or analyze them. My expertise includes developing software solutions for various applications, including audio technologies, and working with databases in Django. I hold a certification in Computer Science and have experience with multiple programming languages.

**Some of my repositories are educational** and contain experiments aimed at exploring new techniques and concepts. These projects serve as learning tools and may not be fully developed software solutions.
